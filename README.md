# Valentina Web

Valentina Web is a server-rendered web app for running [Vampire: The Masquerade](https://www.worldofdarkness.com/vampire-the-masquerade) chronicles with the [Valentina Noir API](https://github.com/natelandau/valentina-noir). Players manage character sheets, spend experience, roll dice,and track inventory; storytellers run campaigns, grant XP, etc. The stack is Flask, HTMX, and AlpineJS, so there's no JavaScript build pipeline to fight with.

## Features

- Character sheets with traits, disciplines, inventory, and notes
- Experience tracking and trait editing with multiple spend modes
- Campaign and chronicle management for storytellers
- Role-based permissions for players, storytellers, and admins
- OAuth login via Discord, GitHub, or Google
- Server-rendered HTML with HTMX for interactivity, no SPA build step

## Tech Stack

- Flask 3.1+ on Python 3.13
- JinjaX templates on top of Jinja2
- HTMX and AlpineJS (loaded from a CDN)
- Tailwind CSS v4 and daisyUI v5
- Redis for caching and sessions
- Authlib for OAuth
- valentina-python-client for API access (see the [API docs](https://docs.valentina-noir.com/))

## Prerequisites

Before you install, make sure you have:

- Python 3.13
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)
- Node.js and npm (for building the Tailwind CSS)
- A running Redis instance
- Access to the [Valentina Noir API](https://docs.valentina-noir.com/), along with an API key

## Quick Start

Clone the repo and install both the Python and Node dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/natelandau/valentina-web.git
cd valentina-web
uv sync      # Python dependencies
npm install  # Tailwind CSS and daisyUI, used to build the stylesheet
```

Copy the example env file and fill in your values:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.secret
```

At a minimum, set `VWEB_SECRET_KEY`, the `VWEB_API__*` block, and (for production) `VWEB_REDIS__URL`. See [Configuration](#configuration) for details.

Start Flask and the Tailwind CSS watcher together:

```bash
duty run
```

The app runs at <http://127.0.0.1:8089>. `duty run` builds `src/vweb/static/css/style.css` and rebuilds it whenever a template or `input.css` changes. That file is gitignored, so it does not exist on a fresh clone until the first build. If you skip the build, pages load without any styling.

To run Flask on its own, build the stylesheet first:

```bash
duty css     # Build src/vweb/static/css/style.css once
uv run vweb  # Start the dev server without the watcher
```

## Configuration

Configuration is handled by [pydantic-settings](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/concepts/pydantic_settings/). Every variable uses the `VWEB_` prefix, and nested settings use double underscores (for example, `VWEB_API__BASE_URL`). Secrets are read from `.env.secret` in the project root.

The most important variables:

| Variable                             | Description                                                                                 |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `VWEB_ENV`                           | `development` or `production`. **Defaults to `production`**, which forces an HTTPS redirect (`VWEB_FORCE_HTTPS`) — set `VWEB_ENV=development` for local runs without a TLS-terminating proxy, or the app will look dead in the browser. Production mode enforces Redis and a non-default secret key. |
| `VWEB_SECRET_KEY`                    | Flask session secret. Must be changed for production.                                       |
| `VWEB_API__BASE_URL`                 | URL of the Valentina API.                                                                   |
| `VWEB_API__API_KEY`                  | API key for the Valentina API.                                                              |
| `VWEB_REDIS__URL`                    | Redis connection URL.                                                                       |
| `VWEB_OAUTH__DISCORD__CLIENT_ID`     | Discord OAuth client ID.                                                                    |
| `VWEB_OAUTH__DISCORD__CLIENT_SECRET` | Discord OAuth client secret.                                                                |
| `VWEB_OAUTH__GITHUB__CLIENT_ID`      | GitHub OAuth client ID.                                                                     |
| `VWEB_OAUTH__GITHUB__CLIENT_SECRET`  | GitHub OAuth client secret.                                                                 |
| `VWEB_OAUTH__GOOGLE__CLIENT_ID`      | Google OAuth client ID.                                                                     |
| `VWEB_OAUTH__GOOGLE__CLIENT_SECRET`  | Google OAuth client secret.                                                                 |
| `VWEB_OAUTH__APPLE__SERVICES_ID`     | Sign in with Apple Services ID (the web client ID).                                         |
| `VWEB_OAUTH__APPLE__TEAM_ID`         | Apple Developer Team ID.                                                                    |
| `VWEB_OAUTH__APPLE__KEY_ID`          | Sign in with Apple key ID.                                                                  |
| `VWEB_OAUTH__APPLE__PRIVATE_KEY`     | Sign in with Apple `.p8` key contents (PEM, newlines escaped as `\n`).                      |

`.env.example` documents every available setting (timeouts, retries, logging, Docker runtime, etc.). See `src/vweb/config.py` for the full schema.

## Authentication

Valentina Web supports Discord, GitHub, Google, and Apple OAuth. Provider-specific setup guides live in `docs/`:

- [Discord OAuth setup](docs/oauth-discord.md)
- [GitHub OAuth setup](docs/oauth-github.md)
- [Google OAuth setup](docs/oauth-google.md)
- [Sign in with Apple setup](docs/oauth-apple.md)

New accounts register as `UNAPPROVED` and can't access the app until an admin approves them.

## Development

Common commands:

```bash
uv run vweb           # Start the dev server on 127.0.0.1:8089
duty run              # Flask + Tailwind watcher
duty test             # Run the test suite with coverage
duty lint             # Run ruff, ty, typos, and pre-commit
duty css              # Build production (minified) CSS
uv run pytest tests/  # Run tests directly
```
